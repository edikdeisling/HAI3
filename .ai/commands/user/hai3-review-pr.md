# hai3:review-pr - Review Code Changes

Ask the user for:
1. Files changed (or analyze git diff)
2. Purpose of changes

Then perform comprehensive review:

## 1. ROUTE TO TARGET FILES

Use `.ai/GUIDELINES.md` routing table to identify which target files apply.

## 2. SUMMARIZE APPLICABLE RULES

For each applicable target file, list 3-7 key rules.

## 3. ANALYZE CHANGES

Check for violations in each category:
