# hai3:arch-explain - Explain HAI3 Architecture Concepts

Ask the user which concept they want explained, or detect from context:

1. **Event-Driven Flow**: Action → Event → Effect → Slice pattern
2. **Registry Pattern**: Self-registration and Open/Closed principle
3. **Three-Layer Architecture**: uikit-contracts → uikit + uicore → app
4. **Screenset Structure**: Vertical slices with screens, state, events
5. **Dependency Rules**: Package isolation and import rules
6. **Type Safety**: Module augmentation and contract enforcement
7. **Theme System**: Theme tokens and application
8. **API Services**: Domain-based services with mocks
9. **i18n System**: Namespace-based lazy loading
10. **Build Order**: Package dependency chain
